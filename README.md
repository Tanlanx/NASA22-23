The Carrington Event was the biggest geomagnetic storm ever recorded. If a geomagnetic storm of similar magnitude occurred today, we would have blackouts and power outages that could last for years. Most of the world would collapse due to the dependence on electricity. The damage from a Carrington-Level geomagnetic storm can be easily reduced if we have the warning to allow us to turn off our power plants, power distribution plants, etc. Our model, Neutron, can predict the solar wind speeds, intensities, and temperatures using magnetic field data from DSCOVR to allow the earth to prepare for a geomagnetic storm and increase our chances of minimizing the effects of this devastating disaster.
